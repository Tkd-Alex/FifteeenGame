FifteenGame is a remake of the famous ["Game of Fifteen"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) developed in Processing / Java used the IDE of Processing 3.0

>The 15-puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen, Mystic Square and many others) is a 	sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The 	puzzle also exists in other sizes, particularly the smaller 8-puzzle. If the size is 3×3 tiles, the puzzle is called 	the 8-puzzle or 9-puzzle, and if 4×4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle or 16-puzzle named, respectively, 	for the number of tiles and the number of spaces. The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order (see 	diagram) by making sliding moves that use the empty space.
